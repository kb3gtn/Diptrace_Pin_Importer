Generial Instructions:
Using a spread sheet tool (Excel or openoffice Calc) generate a spreadsheet with 3 columns {Pin Name,Pin,Sub Part}
This should be used as the first row in your spread sheet.

Now fill in the information for your part into the spreadsheet.
Sort the spread sheet by Sub Part feild.  (not nescessary, but makes the part generation in order)
Save the spread sheet as comma sperated value file. (.csv)  Make sure you when you save it, you tell the tool not to
wrap text strings with quotes (").  This will break in input parser..

In open office calc, you need to check the "edit filter operations" box in the save dialog, and delete the (") in the text delimiter entry.


Data format requirements:

The input parser assumes the following 2 things about pin names:
1) there are no spaces in the names.
2) strings are not encompessed by quotes ("pin_name" = fail, pin_name = pass)

There are 3 columns in the .csv input file.
1) This is the pin name string.. anything but "`' are allowed. (Though dip trace may add nother constraints..)
2) The pin number is interperated as a string in this program, can be anything byt "`'.
3) This last group contains a number, this is is the sub part group you want this pin to be placed in.
   the grouping is used when making multi block components.  If not using, just asign everything to group 1.
   
   

There is a spartan 6 example .csv file include in Git for this project, you can use it to understand the formating requirments.

After you run the tool, you will get a .asc file.  This is a dip-trace ascii interchange file, import this file using dip trace component editor.
