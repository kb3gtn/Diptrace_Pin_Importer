  This tool is a simple tool to help build a basic model of a complex component
  in dip trace.  The stock capabilities are very lacking in this area for making
  complicated components.
  
  This tool will import a CVS files of the pin map information and build a simple
  dip trace component which can then be further editited in dip trace..
  
  This tool was writting in C++ using Qt5, so you will need to QT5 tools to build this code. 
  QtCreator can be used to open the project file and build into an executable.
